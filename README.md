This is my own project
1. Here's a simple C programming task that you can work on as a beginner:

Task: Temperature Converter

Description: Write a C program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. The program should prompt the user to enter a temperature value and its corresponding unit (Fahrenheit or Celsius). It should then convert the temperature to the other unit and display the converted value.

Requirements:

The program should handle both Fahrenheit to Celsius and Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions.
The conversion formulas are as follows:
Fahrenheit to Celsius: C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9
Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C * 9 / 5) + 32
The program should display the converted temperature with two decimal places.
The program should handle invalid input gracefully. For example, if the user enters an invalid unit or an invalid temperature value, display an appropriate error message.

2. Here's a beginner-friendly C programming task involving arrays:

Task: Array Average

Description: Write a C program that calculates the average of an array of integers. The program should prompt the user to enter the size of the array and then the individual elements. After calculating the average, the program should display the result.

Requirements:

Prompt the user to enter the size of the array.
Declare the array with the specified size.
Prompt the user to enter the elements of the array.
Calculate the average of the array elements.
Display the average to the user.
